# EnriChMUS

Tired of all the cool Spotify kids, flexing on us with their Discord presence ?
I have the solution for you fella boomers, enough Monsters for today and go install EnriChMUS.

# Instalation

It's one of my first utilitary scripts, please be indulgent !

    (sudo) npm install -g enrichmus

## Usage

Open that terminal of yours, and let the flex begin.

 1. Launch CMUS
 2. Launch EnriChMUS ( if installed globally just run `enrichmus` )
Pull your best playlist and flex on them wibbas.
